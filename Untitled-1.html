    The population of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) has plummeted over the last century due to poaching, retaliatory killing from crop raiding and habitat fragmentation (Gara, 2016; Poulsen et al., 2017; Sibanda & Murwira, 2012). To ensure conservation is achieved accurate monitoring is vital. Inaccurate counts can result in misallocation of scarce conservation resources and misunderstanding population trends. Existing techniques are prone to miscounting. The most common survey technique for elephant populations in savannah environments is aerial counts from manned aircraft (Schlossberg et al., 2016). Aerial surveys are conducted either as total counts – flying closely spaced transects, or sample counts, covering 5-20% of an area and extrapolating to a larger area. Several studies have shown that observers on aerial surveys often miscount due to fatigue and visibility issues resulting in over-estimates (Caughley et al., 1976; Jachmann, 2002; Koneff et al., 2008). Aerial surveys can be costly, logistically challenging in terms of finding suitable runways and refuelling stops and time consuming in terms of getting appropriate permissions. This is particularly relevant in cross-border areas where multiple national permissions are required. Remotely sensing elephants using satellite imagery and automating detection via deep learning may provide a novel avenue for surveying while mitigating several of the challenges outlined above.

<h1>Materials and Methods</h1>
<p>
    Addo Elephant National Park in South Africa was chosen as the study site. It provides a spectrally complex heterogeneous background with a high concentration of elephants. The park is the third largest park in South Africa at 1640 km2. Different areas of the park have been sectioned off for conservation purposes- elephants were identified in the Main Camp section of the park surrounding Hapoor Dam (Figure 1).The Main Camp is a combination of dense shrubland and low forest e.g.porkbush (Portulcariaafra), White milkwood (Sideroxyloninerme), Cape leadwort(Plumbago auriculate) and open grassland (Kakembo et al., 2015; Tambling et al., 2012). Over six hundred elephants move between these habitats (Du Toit & O’Connor, 2014; Wilgen et al., 2016). Elephants cover themselves in mud to cool down and adopt a range of postures when foraging, playing, sleeping (Soltis et al., 2016; Wickler & Seibt, 1997) so their shape and colour is continually changing. The background environment is also changing as they move between open savannah and woodland and take shelter under trees in the mid-day sun.

<h1>Results</h1>
<p>
    The results show that overall for the CNN in both homogeneous & heterogeneous are as we received an F2 score of 0.75.The CNN performed better in heterogeneous areas with an F2 score of 0.778 compared to 0.73 in homogeneous areas. The human annotator median F2 score was 0.78 and performance was better in homogeneous areas – 0.80 compared to 0.766 in heterogeneous areas. These results show that the CNN performed with high comparable accuracy compared to human detection capabilities.
