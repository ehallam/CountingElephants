        Deep Learning Detects Elephants in Maxar Satellite Imagery on Par with
        Human Accuracy
      </h1>
      <!--Content-->
      <h2>Basic Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Currently the most common survey technique for elephant populations in
        savannah environments is aerial counts from manned aircraft. However,
        observers on aerial surveys can get exhausted, be hindered by poor
        visibility and otherwise succumb to bias. Additionally, aerial surveys
        can be costly and logistically challenging.
      </p>
      <p>
        As researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, University
        of Oxford and Machine Learning Research Group, University of Bath we
        used Maxar’s WorldView-3 satellite imagery and deep learning (TensorFlow
        API, Google Brain) to detect elephants from space with comparable
        accuracy to human detection capabilities.
      </p>
      <h2>Further Information about Satellite</h2>
      <p>
        Maxar satellites (WorldView-3 shown above) can collect upward of 5,000
        km² imagery in one pass over a matter of minutes, eliminating the risk
        of double counting and allowing for repeat surveys at short intervals.
        This unobtrusive technique requires no ground presence so the animals
        are not disturbed, and human safety is not put at risk during data
        collection. Previously inaccessible areas become accessible, and
        cross-border areas–often crucial to conservation planning–can be
        surveyed without the time-consuming requirement of obtaining terrestrial
        permits.
      </p>
      <p>
        We leveraged deep learning to process enormous amounts of WorldView-3
        data in a matter of hours, instead of the months it would have taken us
        to sort it by hand. The deep learning algorithms produce consistent
        results that are less prone to error, false negatives and false
        positives. They also can be rectified by systematically improving
        models–the same cannot be said for humans.
      </p>
      <h2>What Are We Now</h2>
      <p>
        To develop this method, we created a customized training dataset of more
        than 1,000 elephants in South Africa and fed it into a Convolutional
        Neural Network (CNN). The results were then compared to human
        performance. In a MARCH 2019 BLOG POST, we described how we created the
        training dataset and trained the CNN.<br />
        We’re now proud to share the results of our work. The CNN can detect
        elephants in satellite imagery with accuracy as high as human detection
        capabilities. The results (known as the F2 score) of the CNN models was
        0.78 in heterogeneous areas and 0.73 in homogenous areas, compared with,
        an averaged human detection capability F2 score of 0.77 in heterogeneous
        areas and 0.80 in homogenous areas. The model could even detect
        elephants in places far from the training data site showing the
        generalizability of the model. Having trained the machine only on adult
        elephants, it was then able to identify calves.

              <p>
                The population of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) has
                plummeted over the last century due to poaching, retaliatory
                killing from crop raiding and habitat fragmentation (Gara, 2016;
                Poulsen et al., 2017; Sibanda & Murwira, 2012). To ensure
                conservation is achieved accurate monitoring is vital.
                Inaccurate counts can result in misallocation of scarce
                conservation resources and misunderstanding population trends.
                Existing techniques are prone to miscounting. The most common
                survey technique for elephant populations in savannah
                environments is aerial counts from manned aircraft (Schlossberg
                et al., 2016). Aerial surveys are conducted either as total
                counts – flying closely spaced transects, or sample counts,
                covering 5-20% of an area and extrapolating to a larger area.
                Several studies have shown that observers on aerial surveys
                often miscount due to fatigue and visibility issues resulting in
                over-estimates (Caughley et al., 1976; Jachmann, 2002; Koneff et
                al., 2008). Aerial surveys can be costly, logistically
                challenging in terms of finding suitable runways and refuelling
                stops and time consuming in terms of getting appropriate
                permissions. This is particularly relevant in cross-border areas
                where multiple national permissions are required. Remotely
                sensing elephants using satellite imagery and automating
                detection via deep learning may provide a novel avenue for
                surveying while mitigating several of the challenges outlined
                above.

                Addo Elephant National Park in South Africa was chosen as the
                study site. It provides a spectrally complex heterogeneous
                background with a high concentration of elephants. The park is
                the third largest park in South Africa at 1640 km2. Different
                areas of the park have been sectioned off for conservation
                purposes- elephants were identified in the Main Camp section of
                the park surrounding Hapoor Dam (Figure 1). The Main Camp is a
                combination of dense shrubland and low forest e.g.porkbush
                (Portulcariaafra), White milkwood (Sideroxyloninerme), Cape
                leadwort(Plumbago auriculate) and open grassland (Kakembo et
                al., 2015; Tambling et al., 2012). Over six hundred elephants
                move between these habitats (Du Toit & O’Connor, 2014; Wilgen et
                al., 2016). Elephants cover themselves in mud to cool down and
                adopt a range of postures when foraging, playing, sleeping
                (Soltis et al., 2016; Wickler & Seibt, 1997) so their shape and
                colour is continually changing. The background environment is
                also changing as they move between open savannah and woodland
                and take shelter under trees in the mid-day sun.

                The results show that overall for the CNN in both homogeneous &
                heterogeneous are as we received an F2 score of 0.75.The CNN
                performed better in heterogeneous areas with an F2 score of
                0.778 compared to 0.73 in homogeneous areas. The human annotator
                median F2 score was 0.78 and performance was better in
                homogeneous areas – 0.80 compared to 0.766 in heterogeneous
                areas. These results show that the CNN performed with high
                comparable accuracy compared to human detection capabilities.

                This will benefit society because we can monitor and continue
                protecting elephants to prevent extinction. This will help our
                natural habitats and the people who live in that geographical
                area.
